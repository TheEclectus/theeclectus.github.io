# Stratagem Revolution
A weekend project to piece together a directional input game based on the Helldivers 2 stratagems, as well as play around with CSS animations and React.

Made with TypeScript and React.

## Building
Compiled with `bun build --outfile=index.js index.tsx`, but can probably be built using Node.js (or any other JSX-aware transpiler).
