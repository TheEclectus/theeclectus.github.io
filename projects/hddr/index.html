<h2 id="give-it-a-try">Give it a try!</h2>
<p>You can find the minigame online <a href="/run/StratagemRevolution/">here</a>, or find the source code in its <a href="https://github.com/TheEclectus/HDDR">GitHub repository</a>.</p>
<h2 id="about">About</h2>
<p>&quot;Stratagem Hero&quot; was obviously already taken, so &quot;Stratagem Revolution&quot; (like Dance Dance Revolution, but unfamthomably dumber and less inspired) it is. I was originally going to call it HellDDvR, but that was a bit of a stretch.</p>
<p>My girlfriend and I have been playing a lot of Helldivers 2 lately, and she found a site listing the directional codes for all the in-game stratagems. More than that, though, there was an interactive widget that let her enter the sequence for any given stratagem, like a low-stress practice run.</p>
<p>So of course my first thought was, &quot;huh, I bet I could make something like that&quot;. This project represents the cumulative few hours of work I put into that whim, and was a good exercise for making a React application that involved CSS animations and assets in need of preloading.</p>
<h2 id="technical-decisions">Technical Decisions</h2>
<ul>
<li>The stack is TypeScript, React, and Bun (exclusively for its TS compiler/bundler, no host is necessary to play).</li>
<li>No postprocessed CSS.</li>
<li>There are no remote resources to fetch; all available stratagems are configured as a list of objects in the source.</li>
<li>Mobile/responsive layouts weren&apos;t a consideration, considering four arrow keys/WASD are needed. The assumption is you&apos;ll be playing on a 1920x1080 screen, however it can be comfortably played at resolutions down to around 950x640.</li>
<li>Caching of assets (.svg and .png) files is accomplished by <code>await</code>ing the loading of <code>HTMLImageElement</code>s with a <code>src</code> attributes pointing toward each one.</li>
</ul>
